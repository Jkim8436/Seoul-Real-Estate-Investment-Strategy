# 🏙️ Seoul Real Estate Investment Analysis (2018–2024)

A data-driven investment decision framework that recommends the optimal **district (gu) × building type** combination in Seoul based on an investor's risk profile — Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive.

> **"Instead of gut feeling, let the data decide where to invest."**

## 📌 Project Overview

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Period** | 2018 – 2024 (7 years) |
| **Scope** | 25 districts × 4 building types in Seoul |
| **Data** | Seoul Open Data Plaza — Real Estate Transaction Records |
| **Approach** | Z-score normalization + weighted composite scoring |
| **Deliverable** | TOP 3 district × building type recommendations per investor profile |

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Seoul's real estate market exhibits significant price variation across districts. However, most analyses rely on a single metric — price — which fails to capture the full investment picture.

**Key questions this project answers:**
- Which districts offer the best risk-adjusted returns for each investor type?
- Is a high-price district always a good investment, or are there undervalued areas?
- How stable are these recommendations when the scoring weights are adjusted?

---

## 🔬 Analysis Framework

Three metrics are evaluated for each district, standardized via Z-score, and combined with investor-profile-specific weights:

| Metric | Definition | Preferred Direction |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Growth** | Average annual price-per-pyeong growth rate (2018–2024) | Higher ↑ |
| **Price** | Current price-per-pyeong relative to Seoul average | Lower (undervalued) ↓ |
| **Volatility** | Standard deviation of annual growth rates | Lower (stable) ↓ |

### Investor Profile Weights

| Profile | Growth | Price | Volatility | Total |
|---------|--------|-------|------------|-------|
| Conservative | 0.5 | 1.0 | **1.5** | 3.0 |
| Balanced | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 3.0 |
| Aggressive | **1.5** | 1.0 | 0.5 | 3.0 |

> All profiles sum to **3.0** → scores are on the same scale for fair cross-profile comparison.

---

## 🧠 Key Decisions & Rationale

### Why Z-score normalization?
Growth (%), price (10k KRW/pyeong), and volatility (%) have completely different units and scales. Summing them directly would let the largest-scale variable (price) dominate the result. Z-score standardizes all metrics to mean=0, std=1 — enabling fair aggregation.

### Why two separate notebooks? (Dual Preprocessing)
| Notebook | Preprocessing | Reason |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Market Overview | **Raw data preserved** | Extreme values (e.g., 2021–2022 surge) are meaningful market signals — removing them distorts trends |
| Investment Analysis | **IQR-based outlier removal** | Outliers skew Z-scores and distort district rankings |

### Are the weights arbitrary?
A **sensitivity analysis** was conducted across 7 weight scenarios (±0.2 range). The TOP 3 results remain stable across all scenarios, confirming that the recommendations are **robust**, not artifacts of arbitrary weight choices.

## 📊 Key Findings

### Seoul Market Trends (2018–2024)
- Average transaction price increased significantly, peaking around **2021–2022**
- Transaction volume dropped sharply after 2022 as interest rates rose
- Year-over-year growth rate turned negative in 2023 before recovering

### Investment Recommendations (District × Building Type)

| Profile | TOP 1 | TOP 2 | TOP 3 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Conservative | Dobong-gu (Row house) | Gwanak-gu (Single-family) | Jungnang-gu (Row house) |
| Balanced | Eunpyeong-gu (Row house) | Geumcheon-gu (Row house) | Jungnang-gu (Row house) |
| Aggressive | Jungnang-gu (Row house) | Jungnang-gu (Officetel) | Geumcheon-gu (Officetel) |

> ※ Exact results depend on the dataset. Run the notebook to reproduce current rankings.

### 💡 Interpretation (So What?)

- Conservative portfolios consistently favor **low-volatility, undervalued outer districts**  
  → Indicates capital preservation strategy dominates return maximization

- Aggressive portfolios concentrate in **mid-tier districts with high growth momentum**  
  → Suggests emerging districts outperform traditional premium areas

- Jungnang-gu appears in both Balanced and Aggressive profiles  
  → Signals a **structurally undervalued yet high-growth district**
